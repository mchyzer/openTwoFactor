# Two factor text uses Grouper Configuration Overlays (documented on wiki)
# By default the configuration is read from twoFactor.text.en.us.base.properties
# (which should not be edited), and the twoFactor.text.en.us.properties overlays
# the base settings.  See the twoFactor.text.en.us.base.properties for the possible
# settings that can be applied to twoFactor.text.en.us.properties
