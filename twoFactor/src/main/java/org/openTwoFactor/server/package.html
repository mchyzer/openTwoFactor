The main documentation wiki for this project is here:

https://flash.isc-seo.upenn.edu/confluence/display/FAST/Two+factor+authentication

The two factor project is a server which runs a UI and WS.  The twoFactorClient project is a 
client which can connect to the WS.

This project is not a PennFAST project, it is a java application with hibernate and some other libraries.

The WS is a restful JSON/XML web service which allows the cosign server to check a two factor token for a user.
If the token is blank, that means that the user has not typed anything in yet, or they left the form blank.
There is a lot of logic to see if a token (or lack of token) is ok, documented on wiki.  Bascially
it depends on if the user has opted in, if the browser is trusted, which service is being accessed, etc.

The UI allows users to opt in to two factor and admins to view logs or opt people out.  There are self
service functions to help a user who is having problems.  Generally there is no required javascript,
ajax, etc, things are very simple.
