<p>
This package contains a small number of collections classes that are needed for beanutils 
to function. The dependencies will be deprecated in the 1.7.0 release and the need for these
classes will be removed in the future. These classes are identical to those in both 2.x and 3.x 
series of commons-collections releases.
